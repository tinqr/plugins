# Setup

Create a new Marrow knowledge store. Follow these steps exactly.

## Step 1: Location

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided and non-empty, use it as the Marrow root path.
Otherwise, ask: **"Where should I create your Marrow? (default: ~/marrow/)"**

Expand `~` to the full home directory path. Store as `MARROW_ROOT`.

If the directory already exists and contains a CLAUDE.md with `<!-- marrow:root:`, tell the user: **"Marrow already exists there! Use `/recall` to load a project."**

## Step 2: Get to know the user

Ask: **"What's your name?"**

Store as `USER_NAME`.

Ask: **"What do you do? For example: 'product designer building Flutter apps' or 'backend engineer at a startup'"**

Store as `USER_ROLE`.

Ask: **"Anything else I should know about how you work? (or just hit enter to skip)"**

If they provide something, store as `USER_CONTEXT`. If they skip, set `USER_CONTEXT` to empty.

## Step 3: First project

Ask: **"Let's create your first project. What's it called?"**

Normalize to kebab-case. Store as `PROJECT_NAME`.

Ask: **"Tell me about PROJECT_NAME — what are you working on?"**

Store as `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION` (1-3 sentences).

## Step 4: Create directory structure

```bash
mkdir -p MARROW_ROOT/.marrow
mkdir -p MARROW_ROOT/.claude/commands
mkdir -p MARROW_ROOT/PROJECT_NAME
mkdir -p MARROW_ROOT/scripts
```

## Step 5: Generate commands

Write these 5 command files to `MARROW_ROOT/.claude/commands/`. These become `/checkpoint`, `/recall`, etc. — the daily-use commands with no prefix.

Write `MARROW_ROOT/.claude/commands/checkpoint.md`:

````
---
description: Save your session progress
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep
argument-hint: "[project-name] — project to checkpoint (or infer from context)"
---

# Checkpoint

Save your session's progress. This is how context survives between sessions.

## Preflight

Check that `./CLAUDE.md` contains `<!-- marrow:root:v0.5.2 -->`. If not, tell the user: **"This isn't a Marrow directory. You can set one up with `/marrow:setup`."**

## Step 1: Identify the project

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided:** Use it as the project name.

**If no argument:** Infer from conversation context — which project was the user working on? If ambiguous, ask.

Verify `./PROJECT_NAME/CLAUDE.md` exists.

## Step 2: Write session log entry

Get the current time:
```bash
date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
```

Review the conversation to understand what happened this session. Compose a session log entry:

```
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [Claude Code]
**What changed:**
- <bullet per meaningful change>

**Decisions:**
- <bullet per decision, with brief rationale>

**Next:** <one sentence — what should happen next>
```

Append this entry to `./PROJECT_NAME/CLAUDE.md` at the end of the `## Session Log` section.

## Step 3: Archive overflow

Count the `### ` entries under `## Session Log` in the project's CLAUDE.md.

If count > 10: move the oldest entry to the bottom of `./PROJECT_NAME/session-archive.md`. Repeat until exactly 10 entries remain.

## Step 4: Maintain notes

Track how many notes were touched. For any notes created or modified during this session:

1. Read each note, find all outgoing `[[wiki links]]`
2. For each link target, check if a matching `.md` file exists in the project directory
3. If the target exists but doesn't link back, add a `## Backlinks` section (or append to existing) with a wiki link back

Store the count of notes processed as `NOTES_COUNT`.

## Step 5: Update global index

Read `./index.md`. Find the `## PROJECT_NAME` section.

For any notes created or modified this session, ensure they appear in the project's section of the global index with their description. Add new entries, update changed descriptions. Keep entries sorted alphabetically.

If the project has no section yet, create one.

## Step 6: Update projects.md

Read `./projects.md`. Find the `### Activity` section under `## PROJECT_NAME`.

Append a new activity entry at the top of the activity list:

```
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [Claude Code] <one-line summary>. Next: <next step>
```

If > 5 activity entries, remove the oldest until exactly 5 remain.

## Step 7: Write timestamp

```bash
date +%s > .marrow/last-checkpoint
```

## Step 8: Confirm

If `NOTES_COUNT` > 0:
**"Checkpointed PROJECT_NAME. Session logged, NOTES_COUNT notes indexed."**

If `NOTES_COUNT` is 0:
**"Checkpointed PROJECT_NAME. Session logged."**
````

Write `MARROW_ROOT/.claude/commands/recall.md`:

description: Load a project's full context
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
argument-hint: "[project-name] — project to recall (or omit to see all)"
---

# Recall

Load and summarize a project's current state.

## Preflight

Check that `./CLAUDE.md` contains `<!-- marrow:root:v0.5.2 -->`. If not, tell the user: **"This isn't a Marrow directory. You can set one up with `/marrow:setup`."**

## Step 1: Identify the project

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided:** Use it as the project name. Verify `./PROJECT_NAME/CLAUDE.md` exists.

**If no argument but conversation context makes the project obvious:** Use that project.

**If ambiguous:** Read `./projects.md` and summarize all projects with their status and last activity. Ask: **"Which project should I load?"**

## Step 2: Read project context

1. Read `./PROJECT_NAME/CLAUDE.md` — get description, active tasks, and session log
2. Read `./index.md` — find the `## PROJECT_NAME` section for its knowledge map

## Step 3: Check staleness

Look at the most recent session log entry's date. If it's 7+ days ago and the project is active, note it:

**"Heads up — last checkpoint was [N] days ago. Some context might be stale."**

## Step 4: Summarize

Present a clear summary:

1. **Project:** name and description
2. **Active tasks:** from the Active Tasks section
3. **Last session:** date, agent, what changed, decisions
4. **Next step:** from the last session log's "Next:" field
5. **Knowledge:** list of notes for this project from index.md with brief descriptions
6. **Staleness note** if applicable

End with: **"Ready to work on PROJECT_NAME."**

description: Add a new project to your Marrow knowledge store
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Bash, Edit
argument-hint: "[project-name] — optional project name"
---

# New Project

Add a new project to this Marrow.

## Preflight

Check that `./CLAUDE.md` contains `<!-- marrow:root:v0.5.2 -->`. If not, tell the user this isn't a Marrow directory. You can set one up with `/marrow:setup`.

## Step 1: Project name

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided and non-empty, use it as the project name.
Otherwise, ask: **"What's the project called?"**

Normalize to kebab-case (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces). Store as `PROJECT_NAME`.

Check if `./PROJECT_NAME/` already exists. If it does, tell the user the project already exists and stop.

## Step 2: Project description

Ask: **"Tell me about PROJECT_NAME — what are you building?"**

Store as `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION` (1-3 sentences).

## Step 3: Create project files

Create the directory:
```bash
mkdir -p ./PROJECT_NAME
```

Write `./PROJECT_NAME/CLAUDE.md`:
```
<!-- marrow:project:PROJECT_NAME:v0.5.2 -->
# PROJECT_NAME

PROJECT_DESCRIPTION

## Active Tasks

(none yet)

## Session Log
```

Write `./PROJECT_NAME/session-archive.md`:
```
# Session Archive

Archived session log entries, oldest first.
```

## Step 4: Update projects.md

Append a new project section to `./projects.md`:

```
## PROJECT_NAME
Status: active

### Activity
```

## Step 5: Add to global index

Read `./index.md`. Append a new section:

```
## PROJECT_NAME

(No notes yet.)
```

## Step 6: Confirm

Print: **"Project 'PROJECT_NAME' created! Use `/recall PROJECT_NAME` to start working on it."**

argument-hint: "[project-name] — Marrow project to connect to"
---

# Joint

Connect an external project folder to Marrow. A joint is where two bones meet — your project folder and Marrow's knowledge.

## Preflight

Determine the Marrow root. Check common locations in order:
1. If `./CLAUDE.md` contains `<!-- marrow:root:v0.5.2 -->`, the current directory IS the Marrow root.
2. If `~/marrow/CLAUDE.md` contains the marker, use `~/marrow/`.
3. Otherwise, tell the user this isn't a Marrow directory. You can set one up with `/marrow:setup`.

Store as `MARROW_ROOT`.

Determine the external project folder path. This is the current working directory if it's NOT the Marrow root. If the user is in the Marrow root, ask: **"What's the path to the project folder you want to connect?"**

Store as `FOLDER_PATH`.

## Step 1: Identify the Marrow project

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the project name.
Otherwise, list projects from `MARROW_ROOT/projects.md` and ask which one to connect.

Store as `PROJECT_NAME`. Verify `MARROW_ROOT/PROJECT_NAME/CLAUDE.md` exists.

## Step 2: Update project CLAUDE.md in Marrow

Read `MARROW_ROOT/PROJECT_NAME/CLAUDE.md`. If it doesn't already have a `Path:` field, add one after the project description:

```
Path: FOLDER_PATH
```

## Step 3: Update projects.md

Read `MARROW_ROOT/projects.md`. Under the `## PROJECT_NAME` section, if there's no `Path:` line, add one after the `Status:` line:

```
Path: FOLDER_PATH
```

## Step 4: Create or update CLAUDE.md in the external project folder

Check if `FOLDER_PATH/CLAUDE.md` exists.

**If it does NOT exist:** Create `FOLDER_PATH/CLAUDE.md` with:

```
<!-- marrow:joint:PROJECT_NAME -->
# PROJECT_NAME

(Add project architecture and conventions here)

---

## Marrow

This project's knowledge store is at `MARROW_ROOT/PROJECT_NAME/`.

When starting work on this project:
1. Read `MARROW_ROOT/PROJECT_NAME/CLAUDE.md` for session history and context
2. Read `MARROW_ROOT/index.md` for the knowledge map

When finishing work:
1. Use `/checkpoint` to save progress (if Marrow plugin is installed)
2. Or manually append a session log entry to `MARROW_ROOT/PROJECT_NAME/CLAUDE.md`
```

**If it DOES exist:** Append the Marrow pointer section at the end of the existing CLAUDE.md. Do NOT overwrite existing content:

```

<!-- marrow:joint:PROJECT_NAME -->

---

## Marrow

This project's knowledge store is at `MARROW_ROOT/PROJECT_NAME/`.

When starting work on this project:
1. Read `MARROW_ROOT/PROJECT_NAME/CLAUDE.md` for session history and context
2. Read `MARROW_ROOT/index.md` for the knowledge map

When finishing work:
1. Use `/checkpoint` to save progress (if Marrow plugin is installed)
2. Or manually append a session log entry to `MARROW_ROOT/PROJECT_NAME/CLAUDE.md`
```

Replace `MARROW_ROOT` and `PROJECT_NAME` with actual values in all generated content.

## Step 5: Confirm

Print: **"Connected! `FOLDER_PATH` now points to `MARROW_ROOT/PROJECT_NAME/` for full context."**
````

Write `MARROW_ROOT/.claude/commands/reindex.md`:

description: Rebuild the global index and fix wiki link gaps across all notes
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
argument-hint: "[project-name] — project to reindex (or omit to reindex all)"
---

# Reindex

Rebuild the global index and maintain wiki links. Run this when the knowledge base needs tidying — not every session.

## Preflight

Check that `./CLAUDE.md` contains `<!-- marrow:root:v0.5.2 -->`. If not, tell the user this isn't a Marrow directory. You can set one up with `/marrow:setup`.

## Step 1: Identify the project(s)

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided:** Use it as the project name. Verify `./PROJECT_NAME/` directory exists. Run Steps 2–4 for that project only.

**If no argument:** Read `./projects.md` and collect all project names. Run Steps 2–4 for each project.

## Step 2: Extract all wiki links

Run the helper script:
```bash
bash ./scripts/extract-links.sh ./PROJECT_NAME/
```

If the script doesn't exist, run inline:
```bash
for f in ./PROJECT_NAME/*.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] || continue
  links=$(grep -oh '\[\[[^]]*\]\]' "$f" | sort -u | tr '\n' ', ' | sed 's/, $//')
  echo "$(basename "$f")|$links"
done
```

Read the output. Each line: `filename|[[link1]], [[link2]], ...`

## Step 3: Identify gaps

From the link inventory:

1. **Missing backlinks:** Note A links to `[[B]]` but note B doesn't contain `[[A]]`
2. **Orphan notes:** Notes that no other note links to (no incoming links). Exclude `CLAUDE.md` and `session-archive.md` from orphan detection.
3. **Dangling links:** `[[target]]` where no file matching `target.md` exists in the project directory

## Step 4: Fix missing backlinks

For each missing backlink:
- Open the target note
- If it has a `## Backlinks` section, append the link there
- If it doesn't, add a `## Backlinks` section at the end with the link

Format: `- [[source-note]] — links here`

## Step 5: Rebuild global index.md

Write a fresh `./index.md` with all notes across all projects:

```
# Index

Global knowledge map. Notes grouped by project.

## PROJECT_NAME_1

- [[note-title-1]] — description from frontmatter
- [[note-title-2]] — description from frontmatter

## PROJECT_NAME_2

- [[note-title-3]] — description from frontmatter
...
```

For each project, list ALL notes (excluding CLAUDE.md and session-archive.md). For each note, read its frontmatter `description` field. If no description, use "(no description)".

Sort notes alphabetically within each project section. Only include project sections that have notes.

## Step 6: Report

Print a one-line summary: **"Reindexed — N notes across M projects, N backlinks added."**

Then, only if there are issues:
- If there are orphan notes, warn: "Orphan notes (no incoming links): list. Consider linking these from other notes or removing them."
- If there are dangling links, warn: "Dangling links (no matching file): list. Consider creating these notes or removing the links."
````

## Step 6: Generate root CLAUDE.md

Write to `MARROW_ROOT/CLAUDE.md` with the following content. Replace `USER_NAME`, `USER_ROLE`, and `USER_CONTEXT` with actual values. If `USER_CONTEXT` is empty, omit it (don't leave a trailing period).

```
<!-- marrow:root:v0.5.2 -->
# Marrow

Your context, across sessions, across tools.

## About You

USER_NAME is USER_ROLE. USER_CONTEXT

## How I Work

I'm your knowledge assistant. I maintain context across your coding sessions so you never lose the thread between conversations.

What I do:
- Keep a session log for each project — what changed, what was decided, what's next
- Connect notes with wiki links so knowledge compounds over time
- Remind you to save your progress before a session ends
- Give you full context when you come back to a project days or weeks later

## Projects

Your projects live in `projects.md`. Each project has its own folder with:
- `CLAUDE.md` — project description, active tasks, and session log
- `session-archive.md` — older session log entries

The global `index.md` maps all notes across all projects.

To see all projects, read `projects.md`. To load a specific project, use `/recall <project>`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/recall` | Load a project's full context (infers which project from context) |
| `/checkpoint` | Save your session progress |
| `/new-project` | Add a new project |
| `/joint` | Connect an external project folder to Marrow |
| `/reindex` | Rebuild the global index and fix broken links |

## Session Log Format

When checkpointing, append to the project's CLAUDE.md under `## Session Log`:

### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [Agent]
**What changed:**
- <bullet per meaningful change>

**Decisions:**
- <bullet per decision, with brief rationale>

**Next:** <one sentence — what should happen next>

Get time with: `date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"`. Agent tag examples: [Claude Code], [Cursor], [Windsurf].

Rolling 10-entry window. Overflow to `<project>/session-archive.md` (oldest first).

## Notes

Create notes at `<project>/note-name.md` (kebab-case). Frontmatter:

---
description: Why this matters
type: note
created: YYYY-MM-DD
topics: []
---

Connect notes with `[[wiki links]]`. Backlinks are maintained automatically at checkpoint.
```

## Step 7: Generate projects.md

Write to `MARROW_ROOT/projects.md`:

```
# Projects

## PROJECT_NAME
Status: active

### Activity
```

## Step 8: Generate project files

Write `MARROW_ROOT/PROJECT_NAME/CLAUDE.md`:

```
<!-- marrow:project:PROJECT_NAME:v0.5.2 -->
# PROJECT_NAME

PROJECT_DESCRIPTION

## Active Tasks

(none yet)

## Session Log
```

Write `MARROW_ROOT/PROJECT_NAME/session-archive.md`:

```
# Session Archive

Archived session log entries, oldest first.
```

## Step 9: Generate global index

Write `MARROW_ROOT/index.md`:

```
# Index

Global knowledge map. Notes grouped by project.

## PROJECT_NAME

(No notes yet.)
```

## Step 10: Write extract-links.sh helper

Write to `MARROW_ROOT/scripts/extract-links.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Extract all wiki links from .md files in a project directory
# Usage: extract-links.sh <project-dir>
# Output: filename|[[link1]], [[link2]], ...

PROJECT_DIR="$1"

if [ -z "$PROJECT_DIR" ] || [ ! -d "$PROJECT_DIR" ]; then
  echo "Usage: extract-links.sh <project-dir>" >&2
  exit 1
fi

for f in "$PROJECT_DIR"/*.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] || continue
  links=$(grep -oh '\[\[[^]]*\]\]' "$f" | sort -u | tr '\n' ', ' | sed 's/, $//')
  basename=$(basename "$f")
  if [ -n "$links" ]; then
    echo "$basename|$links"
  else
    echo "$basename|"
  fi
done
```

Then: `chmod +x MARROW_ROOT/scripts/extract-links.sh`

## Step 11: Confirm

Show the created directory structure.

Print:

**"You're all set! Marrow is ready at `MARROW_ROOT` with your first project, PROJECT_NAME.**

**To get started:** `cd MARROW_ROOT && claude`

**Your commands:**
- `/recall PROJECT_NAME` — load your project's context
- `/checkpoint` — save your progress
- `/new-project` — add another project"
